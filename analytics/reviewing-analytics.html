    <p>Regardless of your specific goals for online video, understanding your audience is a key to developing a successful video strategy. The better you understand your viewers, the easier it is to create content that will engage them. </p>
    <p>The Analytics page offers fast, close to real-time access to analytics data about your videos. Various views are available and can be used to get analytics about your videos. Using these views, you can generate up-to-date reports about video views, play rates and complettion rates  for your videos.</p>
    <p>To view the Analytics page:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Login to Marketing Studio.</li>
      <li>In the primary navigation, click <strong>Analytics</strong>.

      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="timespan">Selecting a time span</h2>
    <p>Use the <strong>DATE</strong> selector dropdown at the top of the page to specify the time period for the report. Note that when a single day is selected, the graphs will display by hour.</p>

      <h3>Reporting time zone</h3>
      <p>Data in the Analytics module is shown using the account's reporting time zone. The time zone is displayed at the top of the page.</p>
      <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="time zone" src="/assets/images/analytics/reporting-timezone.png" /></figure>
      <p>The reporting time zone is used to calculate day boundaries for reporting data. Changing the reporting time zone setting only affects data going forward, and changes are not applied retroactively. If you change this setting, you may see a flat spot or a spike in your data when looking at day boundaries where the change was applied. Updates to this setting may not take effect immediately, and analytics data may continue to refer to the old setting until the system processes the changes.</p>
      <p>The reporting time zone is configured as part of the Video Cloud account settings. For information on changing the reporting time zone, see <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/admin/managing-account-settings.html#account_settings">Managing Account Settings</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="search" class="BCL_conceptTitle">Viewing reports</h2>
    <p>When the Analytics page is opened,  a graph showing total video views per day for the time period selected will be displayed.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Compare previous period" src="/assets/images/analytics/video-views-graph.png" /></figure>
    <p>The report details will be displayed below the graph.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Compare previous period" src="/assets/images/analytics/report-details.png" /></figure>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="compare">Compare to previous period</h2>
    <p>Selecting the <strong>Compare to previous period</strong> checkbox will add an overlay dashed line graph representing the data for the previous period.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Compare previous period" src="/assets/images/analytics/compare-previous.png" /></figure>
    <p>The previous period is based upon what is currently selected for the report date range. For example, if you select a date range of last 7 days, the previous period will be 2 weeks ago. When comparing trends over weeks, it is best to select date ranges that cover complete weeks. For example, if you select a date starting on a Monday, set the end date to a Sunday. If the start date is on a Friday, set the end date to a Thursday. You can also mouse over both the bars and dashed line to see the date and corresponding values.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="details">Report details</h2>
    <p>Report details will display below the graph. All reports will display the following data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Asset</strong> - Video name</li>
      <li><strong>Content Type</strong> - <a href="/get-started/overview-video-content-types.html">Content type</a> assigned to the video</li>
      <li><strong>Created Date</strong> - Date the video was uploaded</li>
      <li><strong>Video Views</strong> - The number of times the video started playing, recorded when the stream is started (does not include rewind or replay); it is not a measure of individual viewers</li>
      <li><strong>Play Rate</strong> - The percentage of users that played the video after it was loaded</li>
      <li><strong>Avg. Percent Viewed</strong> - The average percent watched per video view (calculated by adding all the percentage watched divided by the number of Video Views)</li>
    </ul>
