    <p>Regardless of your specific goals for online video, understanding your audience is a key to developing a successful video strategy. The better you understand your viewers, the easier it is to create content that will engage them. </p>
    <p>The Analytics page offers fast, close to real-time access to analytics data about your videos. Various views are available and can be used to get analytics about your videos. Using these views, you can generate up-to-date reports about video views, play rates and complettion rates  for your videos.</p>

    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Login to Marketing Studio.</li>

    <h2 id="timespan">Selecting a time span</h2>
    <p>Use the <strong>DATE</strong> selector dropdown at the top of the page to specify the time period for the report. Note that when a single day is selected, the report graphs will display by hour.</p>

      <h3>Reporting time zone</h3>
      <p>Data in the Analytics module is shown using the account's reporting time zone. The time zone is displayed at the top of the page.</p>
      <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="time zone" src="/assets/images/analytics/getting-started/reporting-timezone.png" /></figure>
      <p>The reporting time zone is used to calculate day boundaries for reporting data. Changing the reporting time zone setting only affects data going forward, and changes are not applied retroactively. If you change this setting, you may see a flat spot or a spike in your data when looking at day boundaries where the change was applied. Updates to this setting may not take effect immediately, and analytics data may continue to refer to the old setting until the system processes the changes.</p>
      <p>The reporting time zone is configured as part of the Video Cloud account settings. For information on changing the reporting time zone, see <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/admin/managing-account-settings.html#account_settings">Managing Account Settings</a>.</p>
