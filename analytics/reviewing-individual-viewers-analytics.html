    <h2 id="compare">Compare to previous period</h2>
    <p>Selecting the <strong>Compare to previous period</strong> checkbox will add an overlay dashed line graph representing the data for the previous period.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Compare previous period" src="/assets/images/analytics/compare-previous.png" /></figure>
    <p>The previous period is based upon what is currently selected for the report date range. For example, if you select a date range of last 7 days, the previous period will be 2 weeks ago. When comparing trends over weeks, it is best to select date ranges that cover complete weeks. For example, if you select a date starting on a Monday, set the end date to a Sunday. If the start date is on a Friday, set the end date to a Thursday. You can also mouse over both the bars and dashed line to see the date and corresponding values.</p>
