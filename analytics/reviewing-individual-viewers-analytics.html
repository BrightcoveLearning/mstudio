    <p>If viewer IDs are not sent to the analytics data collector from the player, we will try to construct  a viewer ID from the viewer's IP address and user-agent. Viewer analytics are most useful if you have logged in viewers and therefore can identify them reliably. For information on sending a viewer ID, see the <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/analytics/general/analytics-api-unique-users.html#identifyUsers">Analytics API documentation</a>.</p>
    <p>The report will display the following data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Total Viewers</strong> - Total number of viewers</li>
      <li><strong>Known Viewers</strong> - The number of known viewer</li>
      <li><strong>Anonymous Viewers</strong> - The number of anonymous viewers</li>
      <li><strong>Unique Viewers</strong> - The number of unique viewers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <strong>Viewers</strong> table will list all of details for the viewers.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Viewer ID </strong> - Viewer identifier</li>
      <li><strong>Video Views</strong> - The number of times the video started playing, recorded when the stream is started (does not include rewind or replay)</li>
