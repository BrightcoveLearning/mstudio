    <p>Captions can be added to videos and provide additional or interpretive information to individuals who wish to access it. Marketing Studio provides the ability to <a href="/media/generating-captions-videos.html">auto-generate captions</a> for a video or captions can be <a href="/media/managing-text-tracks.html">manually associated</a> with videos. </p>
    <p>Once captions have been added to videos, the caption editor can be used to edit the caption files. The <strong>Tracks</strong> tab on the video details page can be configured to provide captions for a video. </p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Any type of text tracks (i.e.  chapters) can be edited using the caption editor as long as it is a VTT file. When editing, the text will appear in the preview player as a caption but that is not necessarily how it will display to the end viewer.</aside>

    <h2 id="auto-caption">Generating captions</h2>
    <p>The caption editor can be used to generate captions for a video. To generate captions for a video, follow these steps.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Open the caption editor.</li>
      <li>Click <span class="button-blue">Auto caption</span>.</li>
      <li>Select the <strong>Language</strong> to generate the captions in. If a <strong>Language</strong> is not selected, the video language is auto-detected. Selecting a language will improve the caption file generation time and may improve overall accuracy.</li>
      <li>Enter a <strong>Label</strong>. The label is typically set to the language used in the video. The label will be displayed in the CC dropdown in the video player and will be used by viewers to select the captions to be displayed.

      </li>
      <li>Click <span class="button-blue">Done</span>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The page will need to be refreshed when the captions are complete for them to populate in the caption editor. The generated captions will have a <strong>Published</strong> status after they are generated.</p>

    <h2 id="draft">Saving drafts</h2>
    <p>When a caption file is saved as a draft, it will not be displayed to viewers. Drafts are useful when you are in the process of editing or reviewing a caption file. To save a caption file as a draft, open the caption editor and click <span class="button-blue-text-bordered">Save draft</span>. The top of the caption editor will indicate that the caption has a status of <strong>Draft</strong>.</p>

    <h2 id="issues">Known issues and feature gaps</h2>
    <p>Because the caption Editor is not yet a finished feature, there are some known issues/feature gaps that you may want to be aware of. These are listed below and will be resolved in the coming weeks. </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Publish and Unsave workflow</strong> - We recognize that it is not ideal to have to publish a text track and then unpublish separately to hide the captions from end viewers. We are working on making this a single action.</li>
      <li><strong>Overlapping captions</strong> - If one caption has a start time with the same timecode as the previous captionâ€™s end time, they will appear to overlap in the caption player. It will not appear that way to end viewers - the caption line with the same start timecode will win the conflict.</li>
      <li><strong>Timecode errors</strong> - Only numbers and colons are allowed in the timecode field. If you enter in any other character-types (e.g. letters, commas), it will result in an error. To fix this, replace the disallowed characters with a number or colon. </li>
    </ul>
