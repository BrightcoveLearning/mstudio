    <p>To view and edit the details for a video, open the Media page and click on the video card (card view) or the video name (list view). The video details page will open. The top of the page will display the:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Video title</li>
      <li>Video ID</li>
      <li>Created date and time</li>
      <li>Last modified date and time</li>

    <p>The video details are organized into the following sections:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#overview">Overview</a></li>

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Overview</strong> section can be used to view and edit basic video details. An asterisk (*) next to the field name indicates that the field is required. The following details can be edited:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Title</strong> - No more than 255 characters.</li>
      <li><strong>Reference ID</strong> - A unique ID assigned by a publisher to a video or playlist. Limited to no more than 150 characters. The reference ID is distinct from the video ID or playlist ID which are unique IDs generated by Video Cloud. The reference ID enables coordination between Video Cloud and other services such as a publisher's content management system. Note that you can't batch edit the reference ID as two videos can't have the same reference ID. Reference IDs must always be unique. Deleting a video will allow a previously assigned reference ID to be reused.</li>
      <li><strong>Description</strong> - No more than 250 characters. </li>
      <li><strong>Tags</strong> - One or more tags, separated by commas. You can use tags to add videos to smart playlists or to find videos using the CMS API.
        <ul>
          <li>Tags can be up to 128 characters. If any tags have more than 128 characters, an error will be displayed when you attempt to save changes.</li>
          <li>Tags can't contain commas. For example, a tag of "roof, attic + front yard" is not supported.</li>
          <li>A video can have no more than a total of 1200 tags.</li>
          <li>A tag differing only in case (lowercase, uppercase) is handled as an identical tag and the case will automatically match those of the original tag.</li>
          <li>Issues with case sensitivity need to be handled externally to Video Cloud, for example, using JavaScript methods to modify the strings.</li>
          <li>After entering a tag, press the <strong>comma</strong> key or <strong>enter</strong>. Tags that have been added will display in a colored box.
