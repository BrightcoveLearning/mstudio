    <p>To upload videos, click <strong>Media</strong> in the primary navigation. Videos can be uploaded using one of these methods:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Drag and Drop</strong> - Drag files from the file system to the Media page.  The body of the page becomes the drop zone.
        When the file is dropped, the upload process will begin.

      </li>
      <li><strong>File selection dialog</strong> - Click <span class="button-blue"> + Add video</span> and then <strong>Select files</strong> to open a file selection dialog. Browse and select files to upload.</li>
      <li><strong>Remote URL</strong> - Click <span class="button-blue-text-bordered"> + Upload from URL</span> and then <strong>Upload from URL</strong> to specify the location of the source file. Source files must reside on a publicly accessible  URL. Click <span class="button-blue">Upload video</span> when finished.

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the account is enabled for caption generation, the upload settings dialog will open. Enable <strong>Auto captioning</strong> to have <a href="/media/generating-captions-videos.html">captions generated</a> for the video(s).</p>
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/media/uploading-videos/upload-settings.png" /></figure>
    <p>Click the  status drawer icon in the page header to view the upload progress.</p>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: There is no file size limit. Brightcove has tested with uploads as large as 100GB without any issues.</aside>
    <p>To cancel an upload, click the cancel icon associated with the video.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/media/uploading-videos/cancel-upload.png" /></figure>
    <p> <strong>While uploads are in an uploading state, do not close or move away from the Media module.</strong> Doing so may cause an incomplete upload.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"></figure>
    <p>Other tasks can be performed in the Media module while uploads are in progress. When all uploads are complete, the status drawer will display a green circle <img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/media/icon-green-status-drawer.png" />. This indicates the video uploads have completed and it is safe to navigate away from the Media module.</p>
