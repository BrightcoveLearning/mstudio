    </ol>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: There is no file size limit. Brightcove has tested with uploads as large as 100GB without any issues.</aside>
    <p>Once the files have been selected, the file upload will begin. To cancel the upload, click <strong>Cancel Upload</strong>. Click <strong>Dismiss</strong> to remove the file entry from the page. <strong>While uploads are in an uploading state, do not close or move away from the browser window.</strong> Doing so may cause an incomplete upload.</p>

    <p>When the upload is complete, an <strong>Uploaded</strong> status will display. This indicates the video upload  has completed and it is safe to navigate away from the <strong>Videos</strong> page.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/videos/uploader-processing-complete.png" /></figure>
    <p>All uploaded videos will have a status of <strong>Active</strong>. To learn more about video properties, see <a href="/media/editing-video-details.html">Editing Video Details</a>.</p>
