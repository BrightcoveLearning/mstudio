    <p>To cancel the uploads, click <strong>Cancel uploads</strong>. <strong>While uploads are in an uploading state, do not close or move away from the Media page.</strong> Doing so may cause an incomplete upload.</p>

    <p>Other tasks can be performed on the Media page while uploads are in progress. When all uploads are complete, the status drawer will display a green circle <img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/media/icon-green-status-drawer.png" />. This indicates the video uploads have completed and it is safe to navigate away from the Media page.</p>
